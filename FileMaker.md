# FileMaker #

FileMaker is a cross-platform database application from FileMaker Inc. (a subsidiary of Apple Inc.), known for its combination of power and ease of use. It is also noted for the integration of the database engine with its GUI-based interface, which allows users to modify the database by dragging new elements into the layouts/screens/forms that provide the user interface. This results in a "quasi-object" development environment of a kind that is still largely unique in the "industrial strength" database world.
